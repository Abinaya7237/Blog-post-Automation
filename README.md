Abstract

This project titled "Blog Automation Using Java" is a simple console-based application designed to help users create, view, and manage blog posts efficiently. The system allows users to enter a blog title and content, automatically stores the current date, and provides options to save and load blog posts using file serialization. The application utilizes core Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, file handling, and collections. This project aims to simulate the basic functionality of a blogging platform in an offline environment, making it useful for beginners who want to learn Java programming through real-world applications. It serves as a foundational step toward building more advanced blogging systems with graphical interfaces or web integration.

Key Features


1 You can enter a title and content for your blog.

2 The system will automatically attach the current date.

3 Show All Blog Posts:

4 Displays all previously created blog posts in the console.

5 Save Blog Posts to File:

6 Stores all your blog posts in a file (blogdata.ser) on your computer using Java Serialization.

7 This saves your data permanently so it wonâ€™t disappear when you close the app.

8 Load Blog Posts from File:

9 Loads the blog posts from the saved file so you can continue where you left off.

 Technology Used:
 
* Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

* Serialization (for saving/loading data)

* Console Input/Output

   Learning Outcomes:

* Use Java classes and objects effectively

* Implement file handling and serialization

* Work with user input in a menu-based application

* Apply simple data structures like ArrayList
